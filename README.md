# RESTFull API Framework (Node + Express + JWT + MongoDB)

This is a very simeple framework to create REST APIs using Node.js with Express. 
I have used 'jsonwebtoken' npm package for authrization and 'MongoClient' npm package for MongoDb Connection. Both are used as middlewire.  

```
npm install
node app.js
```
